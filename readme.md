Jasy - Web Tooling Framework
============================

Jasy is a powerful Python3-based tooling framework. It makes it 
easy to manage heavy web projects with a strong JavaScript focus. 
Jasy is based on the mature JavaScript parser Narcissus (Spidermonkey) 
by Mozilla. The main goal of Jasy is to offer an API which could be 
used by developers to write their custom build/deployment scripts. 
Your build script is just a normal Python script which includes the 
Jasy-API and defines so-called tasks.


## Installation

There are pre-built packages available for either Windows or Mac users:
https://github.com/zynga/jasy/downloads

Otherwise you can install Jasy on your own. Jasy has a few dependencies
like Python 3 (with PIP), Misaka (Markdown), Msgpack (API data), etc. For
details have a look at [the official documentation](https://github.com/zynga/jasy/wiki/Installation).
