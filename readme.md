New tool chain based on narcissus tree generator.

Goals:

- Light-weight cross platform tool chain for processing JavaScript code
- In the future a replacement for qooxdoo's massive tool chain
- Modular tools instead of one monolithic solution

Done:

- Parser (reworked a lot of stuff from original code)
- Compressor (generate JavaScript code without white-spaces, etc.)
- Local Variable Optimizer

In Progress:

- Variant Processing (Removing debug blocks, ...)

Todo:

- String optimizations
- API data
- ...
